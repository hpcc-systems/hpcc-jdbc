JDBC driver for HPCC platform

To build for Linux:
-------------------

1. Check out sources (for example, to directory ~/hpcc-jdbc)
2. Create a build directory
3. cd to the build directory
4. To create makefiles to build native release version for local machine, run cmake ~/hpcc-jdbc
5. To build the makefiles just created above, run make
6. Jar file will be created in <builddir>/src/com/hpccsystems/jdbcdriver/hpccsystems-jdbcdriver-MAJOR.MINOR.POINT.jar

A Test version can be built by augmenting the cmake command with the "MAKE_TEST_PACKAGE" flag turned on.
1. From build directory, run cmake -DMAKE_TEST_PACKAGE=ON ~/hpcc-jdbc
2. Jar file will be created in <builddir>/src/com/hpccsystems/jdbcdriver/hpccsystems-jdbcdriver-MAJOR.MINOR.POINT-TEST.jar
3. Run test: java -cp <jarfile> org.hpccsystems.jdbcdriver.tests.HPCCDriverTest <param==value>...
   If no parameters are passed in, a "full test" will execute (values in code should be altered to match your environment).

To build using Maven:
---------------------

1. Check out sources (same as above)
2. cd to the project root directory
3. Run _mvn install_ to execute the build using Maven (includes running "standalone" unit tests)
4. Jar file will be created in <project_root>/target/jdbcdriver-MAJOR.MINOR.POINT[-SNAPSHOT].jar
5. _TO DO_ - create a Maven profile to run tests requiring a running HPCC system.

NOTE:  When updating the project version in either version.cmake (cmake) or pom.xml (Maven) please make sure to
update the version in both locations.
